# annotation-styles
Styles I user to annotate my Obsidian.md notes. Eventually I will get around to refractoring the CSS and making it neat and tidier. 

## Usage

I have scripts with AutoHotKey that take my selection and wrap it in a `span` with the the appropriate classes automatically. 

Manually, the styling for the effect and color is separate.
